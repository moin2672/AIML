# Phase 1: Initial Data Preparation (Before Train-Test Split)
These steps are performed on the entire dataset because they typically involve global data quality issues or transformations that don't depend on statistical properties learned from specific data subsets.
  1. **Load Data**
     
  Action: **Read your raw dataset** into a suitable data structure, like a Pandas DataFrame.
  
  Why: You need your data in memory to begin any processing.

  2. **Remove Duplicates**
     
  Action: Identify and remove exact duplicate rows from your entire dataset.
  
  Why: Duplicate observations can unfairly bias your analysis and model training, leading to overly optimistic performance metrics. **Removing them ensures each observation is unique.**
  
  3. **Initial Missing Value Handling (Deletion Strategy)**
     
  Action: At this stage, **you might remove columns or rows with a very high percentage of missing values (e.g., columns that are 80-90% NaNs, or rows that are almost entirely NaNs). This is a structural decision about data quality.**
  
  Why: These parts of the data are often unrecoverable or provide minimal information, and removing them early can simplify subsequent steps.
  
  **Note: Imputation of missing values (e.g., replacing NaNs with mean/median/mode) should NOT happen here. That comes after the train-test split to prevent leakage.**

# Phase 2: Data Splitting (The Most Crucial Step for Leakage Prevention)
This step fundamentally separates your data into what the model can learn from and what it will be evaluated on.

  5. **test_train_split**
     
  Action: Divide your pre-processed dataset into **X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.**
  
  Why: This is the cornerstone of preventing data leakage. The **X_test and y_test sets must remain untouched** by any data transformation or model learning that        derives parameters from the data, acting as truly unseen data for final evaluation.

----
  
# Phase 3: Preprocessing on Training Data (Fit on Train, Transform on Train & Test)
  All subsequent preprocessing steps that involve learning parameters (like means, standard deviations, min/max values, outlier thresholds, or feature selection logic) must be performed only on the training data (X_train) and then applied to both X_train and X_test.
  
  6. **preprocess_data (Comprehensive Feature Engineering & Remaining Imputation)**
  
  Action: This is a broad category. It includes:
  
  **6a. Imputation of Missing Values:** Now, you'd apply sophisticated imputation strategies (mean, median, mode, K-NN imputation, etc.).
  
  Crucial: Fit the imputer on `X_train (imputer.fit(X_train))` and then transform both `X_train` and `X_test (imputer.transform(X_train), imputer.transform(X_test))`.
  
  **6b. Encoding of Categorical Features (if not done globally before split):** If your `encode_features` function takes `X and y` separately, or if it uses encoders    that learn categories (`OneHotEncoder` for categories, `OrdinalEncoder`), this is where you would fit the encoder on X_train and transform both X_train and X_test.
  
  **6c. Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones **(e.g., combining columns, polynomial features, datetime features)**. This should be applied        consistently to both train and test sets.
  
  **6d. Standardization/Scaling:** (If not done via preprocess_data as a single step, see step 7/8).
  
  You should perform standardization or scaling after encoding categorical features like one-hot or ordinal encoding. This is because scaling techniques such as         `StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler` are designed to work with numerical data, and encoding transforms categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for           scaling. Attempting to scale before encoding would result in errors or meaningless transformations for non-numeric data.

  ### Note:
  You should generally **apply standardization or scaling only to numerical features** and ***not to one-hot encoded categorical features***. Hereâ€™s why:

    **One-hot encoded features are already in the range  (with values 0 or 1)**, so scaling them further is unnecessary and does not provide any benefit for most machine learning models.
  
  **Ordinal encoded features (if they represent a true order and are used as numerical values) might sometimes be scaled**, but this depends on the context and the model being used.
  
  **Best practice is to:**
  * Scale only the continuous numerical features.
  * Leave one-hot encoded features as they are.
  * * If you do scale the entire dataset (including encoded features), it usually does not harm, but it is not required and often unnecessary for one-hot encoded columns.
  
  **Summary:**
  *  Scale/standardize only numerical features.
  *  Do not scale one-hot encoded features; they are already normalized

  Yes, you can apply scaling to ordinal encoded features, and whether you should depends on the specific machine learning model you are using.

  ## Why You Might Scale Ordinal Encoded Features
  
  ### Models Sensitive to Feature Scale
  
  * **Distance-Based Algorithms:** Models like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, and **K-Means clustering** calculate distances between data points. If ordinal features have a wide range of values (e.g., 1 to 100), they might dominate the distance calculations compared to other features with smaller ranges (e.g., 1 to 5), even if they are more important. Scaling brings all features to a comparable scale, ensuring they contribute proportionally to distance metrics.
  
  * **Models using Gradient Descent:** Algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks**, and **Gradient Boosting Machines** (though generally less sensitive than distance-based models) often use gradient descent for optimization. Scaling can lead to faster convergence and more stable training by preventing large gradients in some features from overwhelming smaller gradients in others.
  
  * **Regularized Linear Models (Lasso, Ridge):** These models penalize large coefficients. If ordinal features have large numerical values, their coefficients might be artificially shrunk more than necessary if not scaled, or features with smaller ranges might have inflated coefficients. Scaling ensures the regularization applies fairly across all numerical features.
  
  ### Maintaining Ordinality vs. Treating as Continuous
  
  When you use ordinal encoding, you assign numerical values (e.g., 1, 2, 3) to categories that have an inherent order. While these numbers represent rank, the **distance** between them might not be truly equal (e.g., the difference between "Good" and "Very Good" might not be the same as between "Bad" and "Good").
  
  If you treat these ordinal features as continuous numerical features (which scaling implies), you are assuming that the numerical intervals are meaningful. For example, if "Low"=1, "Medium"=2, "High"=3, scaling them implies that the numerical difference between 1 and 2 is equivalent to the difference between 2 and 3. In some cases, this assumption is reasonable enough for the model to learn from.

  ## Why You Might NOT Scale Ordinal Encoded Features
  
  ### Tree-Based Models
  
  **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, **Gradient Boosting Machines** (like LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) are **insensitive to the scale of features**. They make decisions based on thresholds (e.g., "Is 'Education Level' > 2?"). The absolute magnitude of the numbers doesn't affect how the tree splits or calculates feature importance. Therefore, scaling ordinal (or any other numerical) features for these models is generally unnecessary and won't improve performance.
  
  ### Interpretability
  
  If you've assigned specific, meaningful integer values (e.g., 1-5 for a Likert scale) and want to interpret the coefficients or feature importances in terms of those original integer values, scaling would transform them and make direct interpretation harder.
  
  ---
  
  ## Common Scaling Methods for Ordinal Data
  
  If you decide to scale ordinal data, the most common methods are:
  
  * **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization):** Transforms values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1). This can be useful for ordinal features where the range is important.
      Formula: $X_{scaled} = \frac{(X - X_{min})}{(X_{max} - X_{min})}$
  
  * **Standardization (Z-score Scaling):** Transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is generally more robust to outliers (especially if outliers are handled first).
      Formula: $X_{scaled} = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}$
  
  ---
  
  ## Recommendation
  
  * For models **sensitive to feature scale** (e.g., linear models, SVMs, neural networks, KNN): It's generally a **good practice to scale ordinal encoded features** along with your other numerical features.
  * For **tree-based models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting): Scaling ordinal encoded features is **not necessary** and won't typically provide a benefit.
  * **Always test and compare!** The best approach can sometimes be dataset and model-specific. Try training your model both with and without scaling ordinal features (if using a sensitive model) and compare the performance.

  ## Crucial Reminder
  
  As with all preprocessing steps that derive parameters from the data, if you choose to scale ordinal features, you **must fit the scaler ONLY on your training data** and then apply that fitted scaler to both your training and test sets to prevent data leakage.

  ### Note:
  Standardization and normalization of numerical (or encoded) features are **not required** for the following types of machine learning algorithms:

  Tree-based algorithms such as:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  
  **These algorithms are inherently *insensitive* to the scale of the features because they split data based on feature thresholds, not on distances or coefficients.** Therefore, scaling or normalizing features does not impact their performance or the way they learn from data.
  
  For most other algorithmsâ€”especially those that rely on distance calculations (like KNN, SVM) or gradient descent optimization (like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks)â€”scaling is important for optimal performance

  7. **z_outlier_remove / cap_outliers_remove (Numerical Features Only)**
  
  Action: Handle outliers in your numerical features.
  
  * **For z_outlier_remove:** Calculate mean and standard deviation only from X_train to determine Z-scores and removal thresholds. Then apply removal/filtering to both X_train and X_test based on these X_train-derived thresholds.
  
  * **For cap_outliers_remove:** Calculate percentile values (e.g., 5th and 95th percentiles) only from X_train. Then apply these capping values to both X_train and X_test.
    
  Why: Outliers can distort statistical measures and impact model training. These processes are data-dependent, so they must be done after the split.
  
  8. **Standardization (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)**
  
  Action: Scale your numerical features.
  
  Why: Many algorithms (linear models, neural networks, SVMs, k-NN) perform better when numerical features are on a similar scale.
  
  Crucial: Fit the scaler only on X_train (scaler.fit(X_train_numerical)). Then, transform both X_train_numerical and X_test_numerical using this fitted scaler.
  
  9. **select_features_boruta (or other Feature Selection method like select_features_shap)**
  
  Action: Apply your chosen feature selection method.
  
  Why: Reduces dimensionality, removes irrelevant/redundant features, potentially improves model performance, reduces training time, and enhances interpretability.
  
  Crucial: This step must be performed on X_train (and y_train). The Boruta algorithm or SHAP importance calculation will determine which features are important based only on the training data. Once the set of selected features is identified, you then subset both X_train and X_test to include only those selected features.

# Phase 4: Model Development (Using Training Data)
  
  These steps involve building and refining your machine learning model.
  
  10. **Model Creation**
  
  Action: Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., LGBMClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression). Instantiate the model with default parameters or initial guesses.
  
  Why: This is the core of your predictive system.
  
  11. **Model Hyperparameter Fine-Tuning**
  
  Action: Use techniques like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or more advanced optimization methods (e.g., Optuna, Hyperopt) to find the best set of hyperparameters for your chosen model.
  
  Why: Optimizing hyperparameters improves your model's performance.
  Crucial: This tuning must be done using cross-validation on the training data only. You should never use the test set for hyperparameter tuning, as this would lead to leakage.
  
  12. **Model Selection**
  
  Action: If you've trained multiple models (e.g., LGBMClassifier, XGBoost, RandomForest) or different versions of the same model with fine-tuning, this is where you choose the best performing model based on cross-validation results from your training set.
  
  Why: To pick the most promising model for final evaluation.
  
# Phase 5: Final Evaluation

  13. **Final Model Evaluation on Test Set**
  Action: Take your best performing, hyperparameter-tuned model and evaluate its performance once on the untouched X_test and y_test data.

  Why: This provides an unbiased estimate of how your model will perform on truly unseen data in a real-world scenario. If you evaluate on the test set multiple times or use it for tuning, this estimate becomes unreliable.
  
  # **Summary of the Most Critical Data Leakage Points:**
  
  - Train-Test Split: Always the first step after initial data loading and duplicate removal.
  - Any fit() operation on a transformer/scaler/imputer/feature selector: Must be done only on X_train.
  - Any transform() operation: Must be done on both X_train and X_test using the same object that was fitted on X_train.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Selection: Must be done using cross-validation on the training set only.
  - Final Evaluation: Only one final evaluation on the untouched test set.
  - By following this sequence, you build a robust and reliable machine learning pipeline.
